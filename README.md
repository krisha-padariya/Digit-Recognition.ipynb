## Digit Recognition (MNIST)

##  Project Overview
This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. 
It is built with TensorFlow and Keras using a neural network model to perform accurate image classification.

## Dataset
- Dataset: MNIST

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy   
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

- **File**:
  `Digit_recognition.ipynb`

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras
```
